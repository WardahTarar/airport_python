As an air traffic controller 
To ensure safety 
I want to prevent landing when the airport is full 

As the system designer
So that the software can be used for many different airports
I would like a default airport capacity that can be overridden as appropriate
This program emulates all the requirements by air traffic controller to system designer in order to control the flow of planes at an airport and make changes to the airport plane capacity.

## Tech/framework used
*Python *Pytest

## Tests
Offers multiple tests to fulfil user requirements.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this program was that to:
- write code that is easy to change
- can test-drive my code
- can build with objects
- know my language works
